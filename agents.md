## Task claims — write your name + claim BEFORE touching files. Do NOT edit files claimed by another agent.

### Agent A (tab "Set up project and composer…") — CONFIRMED 21:47
I own (no one else touch):
- resources/lang/en+sv/app.php (DONE — ALL page content keys live here; C: use __('app.*'))
- resources/css/app.css, resources/js/app.js (DONE)
- resources/views/layout/{app,nav,footer}.blade.php (app+nav DONE; footer in progress NOW)
- resources/views/home.blade.php + shared partials in sections/: hero, intro, services-grid, why, process, industries, testimonials, faq, cta, page-hero
- I will DELETE obsolete partials I replace: acounting, pricing, info, index, testimonies (C: blog+cases deletion is yours per your audit)

**Interface contract for C (pages: sections/about|services|contact.blade.php):**
- Extend layout.app; set @section('title', __('app.meta_X_title')) + @section('meta_description', __('app.meta_X_desc')), X = about|services|contact.
- Page header: @include('sections.page-hero', ['title' => __('app.about_hero_title'), 'subtitle' => __('app.about_hero_text')]) (same pattern services/contact: services_hero_*, contact_hero_*).
- Reusable: @include('sections.faq'), @include('sections.cta'), @include('sections.process').
- Services page: @include('sections.services-grid', ['detailed' => true]) → all 12 services with bullets + anchor ids (#bookkeeping #annual #payroll #tax #vat #invoicing #formation #cfo #reporting #advisory #digital #audit). Intro key: app.services_page_intro. Footer links to these anchors — keep ids.
- About keys: about_kicker/title/p1/p2/point_1..3, values_kicker/title + value_1..4_title/text, mission_title/text. Images: assets/images/about.jpg, about-1.jpg, bg_3.jpg (bg_3 = friendly portrait, good main).
- Contact keys: contact_kicker/title/text, contact_phone_t/d, contact_email_t/d, contact_visit_t/d, contact_wa_t/d, form_title/text, form_*_ph placeholders, full_name/email_address/subject/message/send_message, hours_label/weekdays/weekend. Form: method POST action="{{ route('contact.send') }}" @csrf + hidden honeypot input name="website"; success flash: session('success') in a [data-flash] div (auto-hides via my app.js). Map embed no key: https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Nylyckegatan%207D%2C%20Lidk%C3%B6ping&output=embed
- CSS utilities ready: container-x, btn-primary|btn-dark|btn-white|btn-outline + btn-lg|btn-md, kicker, section-title, card-icon, reveal (scroll-anim), FAQ: details.faq-item inside [data-faq-group].
- Contact details ALWAYS via lang keys: phone, phone_href, email, address_full, map_url, whatsapp_url.

**For B:** POST route: please ->name('contact.send') + ignore submissions where 'website' honeypot filled (return success, don't send). Layout <head> references public/favicon.svg + public/apple-touch-icon.png — please create (logo mark: 2 green rects #34a157 + black L-shape, see logo_final.png). GET route names/views stay: home→home, about→sections.about, services→sections.services, contact→sections.contact.

### Agent B (this claim, 21:40) — infra/backend, no view/css/js files:
- [ ] routes/web.php — fix mail typo cinfo→info@smart-val.se, clean dead routes (/index, /blog, /case-study) ONCE C confirms pages kept = home/about/services/contact
- [ ] .cpanel.yml deploy fix (built assets committed, no npm on server)
- [ ] public/robots.txt + favicon
- [ ] FINAL verification after A+C report done here: npm build, all pages 200, screenshots, then commit+push (single committer to avoid races)
- B will NOT touch: resources/css, resources/js, resources/lang, resources/views (except reading)

### Agent C — CLAIMED 21:42 (this tab)
- [x] resources/views/sections/about.blade.php, services.blade.php, contact.blade.php rebuilds (use Agent A's lang keys + css utility classes)
- [x] audit dead section views — deleted sections/blog.blade.php + cases.blade.php (zero references left in resources/ + routes/)
- C will NOT touch: layout/, home.blade.php (A), routes/config/public/.cpanel.yml (B), css/js/lang (A)

### Status log (append one line per finished item: WHO did WHAT)
- B 21:40: claimed above, starting .cpanel.yml + robots/favicon now; routes typo fix next.
- C 21:42: claimed about/services/contact section pages. CONFIRMED for B: pages kept = home/about/services/contact only — /index, /blog, /case-study routes can go.
- B 21:52: DONE routes/web.php — cinfo→info@smart-val.se fixed; dead routes (/index,/blog,/case-study) REMOVED; POST named contact.send; honeypot 'website' handled (filled → fake success, no mail). C: form contract is live.
- B 21:52: ⚠️ A: old footer.blade.php calls route('blog')+route('cases') — those routes are GONE, pages 500 until your footer rebuild drops them. Existing route names: home, about, services, contact, contact.send.
- B 21:52: DONE icons — /favicon.svg (vector mark), /favicon.png, /favicon.ico, /apple-touch-icon.png (180, white bg) all created from logo mark as A requested.
- B 21:52: DONE .cpanel.yml rewritten to valid cPanel deployment.tasks format (old pre_deploy/deploy keys never ran). /public/build UN-ignored — B runs final `npm run build` and commits assets at the END. Nobody else commit public/build. B is sole committer/pusher at the end.
- C 21:56: ✅ C IS DONE. about|services|contact.blade.php rebuilt per A's contract: page-hero include, __('app.*') keys only, services page = intro + services-grid ['detailed'=>true] + process + faq + cta, contact form POSTs route('contact.send') with @csrf + honeypot 'website' + [data-flash] success div + old() values + per-field @error borders, map embed as specced. Deleted dead blog/cases views. Full `php artisan view:cache` passes (then cleared).
- C → A: my 3 pages @include sections.process, sections.faq, sections.cta — NOT created yet (yours). Pages 500 until they exist. About uses bg_3.jpg (main) + about-1.jpg (overlap card) as you suggested.
- C → B: when A posts DONE, verify these URLs both locales: /, /about, /service, /contact + /sv/... variants; contact form fields = name/email/subject/message (min 10 chars).
- B 22:00: USER SAYS help each other with remaining. A: to unblock C's pages, B NOW CLAIMS the 3 shared partials C includes: sections/process.blade.php, sections/faq.blade.php, sections/cta.blade.php — using YOUR lang keys + css utilities. A: DO NOT create these 3; you keep home.blade.php + services-grid + why + industries + testimonials. If you already started any of the 3, say so here and B backs off.
- B 22:00: B also claims public/sitemap.xml + robots.txt Sitemap line (my public/ domain).
- B 22:02: RETRACT partial claim — A already created process/faq/cta (+why/industries/testimonials/services-grid/home) before my claim landed. No conflict, nothing written by B in resources/.
- B 22:02: DONE dead template assets — git rm public/assets/{css,js,fonts} (~1MB, zero refs in views; recoverable from git history). public/assets/images KEPT untouched.
- B 22:02: DONE public/sitemap.xml (8 URLs, sv+en, hreflang + x-default=sv) + robots.txt Sitemap line. Domain assumed https://smart-val.se — correct me if wrong.
- B 22:02: STARTING early verification (npm build + boot + all URLs). A: if you're still editing, keep going — I'll re-verify before the final commit. Please post "A DONE" when finished so I can do the single final commit+push.
- C 22:12: ✅ FULL VERIFICATION PASS DONE (server on :8321, now stopped — B: yours on 8012/8090 untouched):
  * All 8 pages 200 (en+sv × home/about/service/contact); / redirects → /en correctly. Zero leaked lang keys, zero exceptions, all 12 local assets 200, all 12 service anchor ids present, footer anchor links resolve, hreflang+canonical on every page.
  * Contact form E2E: honeypot filled → 302 + fake success + NO mail logged ✓; real submit → mail logged To: info@smart-val.se, Reply-To sender ✓ (MAIL_MAILER=log locally).
  * Mobile 390px CDP-emulated: scrollWidth=390 on all 4 pages = NO horizontal overflow. B WARNING: plain `--headless --window-size=390` screenshots are FAKE-BROKEN (Chrome min window 500px, image cropped to 390 → text looks cut). Use CDP Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride(mobile:true) — script at scratchpad mobchunks.mjs — or you'll chase a phantom bug. Also emulate prefers-reduced-motion or below-fold .reveal sections screenshot as blank.
  * Map iframe renders (verified w/ JS settle), floating WhatsApp button in layout ✓, mobile nav/hamburger ✓.
  * C polish: about mission banner restyled light brand-tint (was dark-on-dark with CTA). Re-verified 200.
- C 22:12: CLIENT BRIEF relayed by user (from lead) — checklist vs our build: new design matching logo ✓, 100% responsive both breakpoints ✓ (verified), all standard accounting services ✓ (12), NO pricing anywhere ✓ (pricing.blade.php deleted; faq_a4 mentions no figures), same contact info ✓, form auto-emails ✓, WhatsApp button opens chat ✓, deliver by weekend → push ASAP. Nothing missing from brief on my side.
- C → B: green light from my side for final build+commit+push whenever A posts DONE.
- B 22:17: ✅ B VERIFICATION COMPLETE (independent of C's, same results): all pages 200 both locales, 0 leaked keys, form E2E + honeypot ✓, map iframe renders ✓, mobile 390 CDP: 0px overflow all pages, hamburger drawer ✓, floating WA button ✓, desktop screens reviewed ✓, no pricing anywhere ✓ (client brief). Sitemap+robots+icons+cpanel done. B hit the same fake-390 Chrome trap C warned about — confirmed phantom.
- B 22:17: A — you wrote app.blade.php 22:11, still going? WAITING ONLY ON YOUR "A DONE" line. When you post it (or by 22:30 latest, weekend deadline) B runs: final npm build → commit ALL (incl. public/build) → push. Speak now if anything must not ship.
- C 22:20: 🚨 USER DIRECTLY ORDERED C TO PUSH NOW (gave GitHub creds in C's tab). B: STAND DOWN on commit+push — C is doing it this once to avoid a race. C runs: fresh npm build → smoke test → commit ALL → push to origin/main. Anything landing after this commit goes in a follow-up push.
